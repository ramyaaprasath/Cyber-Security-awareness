               Ever heard of cybersecurity threat?
It's the threat of malicious attack by an individual or organization attempting to gain access to a network, to corrupt data or steal confidential information or any other form of sensitive data.
A successful cyber attack can ruin your years of hardwork and career.  Cyber threats can come from within an organization by trusted users or from remote locations by unknown parties and who knows, it maybe the person next to you!
Former Cisco CEO John Chambers once said, “There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked, and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.”
Cyber attacks hit businesses every day.
So, what do you think cyberattacking is ? Is it just hacking into your system?
Not at all. cyberattacks are much more than hacking just to be termed that.
<br>
Various types of cyberattacks :
Malware-malicious software, including spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. <br>
Phishing- practice of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source, usually through email. <br>
Man-in-the-middle attack-also known as eavesdropping attacks, occur when attackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction.<br> 
Denial-of-service attack-floods systems, servers, or networks with traffic to exhaust resources and bandwidth. As a result, the system is unable to fulfill legitimate requests.<br>
Structured Query Language(SQL) injection-occurs when an attacker inserts malicious code into a server that uses SQL and forces the server to reveal information it normally would not.<br>
Zero-day exploit-hits after a network vulnerability is announced but before a patch or solution is implemented. Attackers target the disclosed vulnerability during this window of time.<br>
DNS Tunneling-utilizes the DNS protocol to communicate non-DNS traffic over port 53. It sends HTTP and other protocol traffic over DNS. There are various, legitimate reasons to utilize DNS tunneling. <br>
It is crucial for an individual or businesses to implement the most basic cyber security measures, and cyber security awareness to protect themselves from various cyber crimes.        </div>

            Website spoofing is the creation of a replica of a trusted site with the intention of misleading visitors to a phishing site. Legitimate logos, fonts, colors and functionality are used to make the spoofed site look realistic. Website spoofing attacks have become increasingly prevalent in recent years. Even unsophisticated attackers can register a domain that's very close to the domain of a trusted brand and build a site that looks identical to the brand's website. 
So is the website you visit well guarded and genuine?
